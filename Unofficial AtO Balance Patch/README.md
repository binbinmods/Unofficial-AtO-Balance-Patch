# Unoffical Balance Patch for Across the Obelisk

The purpose of this mod is to help introduce more possible playstyles. This means that certain powerful cards/combos will be nerfed slightly, and underpowered cards/combos will be buffed.

There will also be reworks to several cards, as well as completely new cards. 

This patch will attempt to keep things balanced, so won't be introducing too many overpowered cards/ideas, but rather should flesh out concepts that are already in the game. 

The mod will be packaged into numerous "modules". You are welcome to turn off any of the modules you think are not fun for the game, though I would recommend leaving them all in.

All of the modules created by me start with "Binbin Balances" though if other community members wish to contribute their own modules, I am more than happy to include them.

**Please, offer feedback either on balance or on any suggestions you might have. I would greatly appreciate all of it!** Feel free to directly message me on Discord, or post in the modding community of the [Across the Obelisk Discord](https://discord.gg/across-the-obelisk-679706811108163701).

Lastly, this mod will be continually updated with new cards, modules, and will also eventually grow to include bug fixes, and mechanics changes (as well as potentially new game modes).
