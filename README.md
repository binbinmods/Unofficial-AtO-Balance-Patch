# Unoffical Balance Patch for Across the Obelisk

The purpose of this mod is to help introduce more possible playstyles. This means that certain powerful cards/combos will be nerfed slightly, and underpowered cards/combos will be buffed.

There will also be reworks to several cards, as well as completely new cards. 

This patch will attempt to keep things balanced, so won't be introducing too many overpowered cards/ideas, but rather should flesh out concepts that are already in the game. 

The mod will be packaged into several "modules". You are welcome to turn off any of the modules you think are not fun for the game, though I would recommend leaving them all in.

All of the modules created by me start with "Binbin Balances" though if other community members wish to contribute their own modules, I am more than happy to include them.

## Items

### Part 1 - Items that add cards to your deck

The first module for items are targeting items such as Dart Pouch or Imp Statuette which add cards to your deck. In general, these items are not very good since they dilute your deck with mediocre cards. 

### Part 2 - (Un)common Items

The focus on these is mostly to improve the corrupted versions of common and uncommon items, giving them a bit more longevity and utility throughout a run

### Part 3 - Pets

Minor buffs to some pets that are rarely or never taken.


# Card Modules

## Nerfs

Some overused cards will receive some nerfs. This will mostly come in the form of increasing the rarity of the card, increasing the cost of the card, or making the card vanish.

Targets mostly: low cost draw cards, undercosted cards, cards that provide too much benefit, and cards that deal too much damage for their cost.

## Thorns

Balance patch to help make thorns more viable. Focuses on improving the card quality of thorns cards.
